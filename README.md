# Bank Servince Unit Testing
This project demonstrates unit testing for a customer's bank service (DEPOSIT, JOIN, TRANSFER MONEY, VIEW BALANCE) and more.

## Design Choices
- **BankArr Array:** I use a global array (`bankArr`) to represent the bank's customer data. Each customer is an object with properties such as `id`, `name`, `balance`, and `transaction_logs`. I use this data structure to simulate customer actions like joining the bank, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balances, and transferring money.

- **Test Structure:** I use Mocha as the testing framework and Chai for assertions. The tests are organized into different describe blocks for customers and the bank manager, with individual it blocks for each specific test case.
